# FlightsDelayPrediction

The data in this report
comes from The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation
Statistics (BTS). In fact, not only in America but also all over the world. The losses caused
by the delay in air transportation are enormous. We are aiming to figure out the main
factors that cause these delays by using different kinds of data mining and data analysis
methods. Our goal is to make better decisions in aviation management through established
analytical prediction models.
